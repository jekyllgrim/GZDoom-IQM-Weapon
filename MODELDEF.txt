	// This is direct frame assignment used only for
	// the Spawn sequence, which uses different scale
	// and offsets. To make it work, we'll disable
	// bDECOUPLEDANIMATIONS in Spawn, but enable it
	// again in AttachToOwner() for the on-screen
	// animations:
	Offset 0 0 16 
	Scale 0.5 0.5 0.5
	Rotating
	Frame M000 Z 0 "pistol_spawn:0"

	// The rest of the definition applies to how the
	// weapon will be rendered on screen
	
	// Offset it to the right and down:
	Offset 14 0 -14
	// Flip it horizontally (otherwise it'll be mirrored)
	// and squish it frontwise to reduce perspective
	// distortion (common trick; thanks Nash!):
	Scale -1 0.5 1
	// Allow attaching other models to the same armature
	// (such as the muzzle flash model):
	ModelsAreAttachments
	// Preserve weapon's perspective regardless of user's
	// chosen FOV:
	ScaleWeaponFOV
	// Apply this to all decoupled animations. This is
	// REQUIRED for them to work, and it must be at
	// the end:
	BaseFrame
